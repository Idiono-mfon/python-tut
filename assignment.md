1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
   string: skybeam Limited

2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
   Sample String : google.com'
   Expected Result : {'g': 2, 'o': 3, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, '.': 1, 'c': 1, 'm': 1}

3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, return the empty string instead.
   Sample String : 'w3resource'
   Expected Result : 'w3ce'
   Sample String : 'w3'
   Expected Result : 'w3w3'
   Sample String : ' w'
   Expected Result : Empty String

4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'

5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
   Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
   Expected Result : 'xyc abz'

6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
   Sample String : 'abc'
   Expected Result : 'abcing'
   Sample String : 'string'
   Expected Result : 'stringly'

7. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substrings 'not' and 'poor' in a given string. If 'not' follows 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.
   Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
   'The lyrics is poor!'
   Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
   'The lyrics is poor!'

8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one.
   Sample Output:
   Longest word: Exercises
   Length of the longest word: 9

9. Write a Python program to change a given string to a newly string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.
   Example:

skybeam Limited

will now be:

dkybeam Limites

11. Write a Python program to remove characters that have odd index values in a given string.

12. Write a Python function that takes two boolean inputs, a and b, and returns the result of the logical AND operation between a and b.

13. Write a Python function that takes two boolean inputs, x and y, and returns True if either x is True or y is True, but not both. Otherwise, return False.

14. Write a Python function that takes a list of boolean values and returns True if all the elements in the list are True. Otherwise, return False.

15. Write a Python function that takes three boolean inputs, p, q, and r, and returns True if at least two of the inputs are True. Otherwise, return False.

16. Write a Python function that takes two boolean inputs, a and b, and returns True if a is True or b is False. Otherwise, return False.

17. Write a Python function that takes two boolean inputs, x and y, and returns True if either x is False or y is False. Otherwise, return False.

18. Write a Python function that takes three boolean inputs, p, q, and r, and returns True if exactly one of the inputs is True. Otherwise, return False.

19. Write a Python function that takes two boolean inputs, a and b, and returns True if a and b are both True or both False. Otherwise, return False.

20. Write a Python function that takes two boolean inputs, x and y, and returns True if x is True and y is False. Otherwise, return False.

21. Write a Python function that takes three boolean inputs, p, q, and r, and returns True if exactly two of the inputs are False. Otherwise, return False.
